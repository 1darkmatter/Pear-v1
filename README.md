## Model description 

Embarking my first LoRa research

As my research purposes to build base model, creating a model using a 3D sculpting approach similar to retrain the model versioning, with a distinctive emphasis on realism, like the contours of a hourglass body and face features. It does not depict anyone real person.

When using for ADetailer or anything with facial improvements, recommend to mention: `a woman with black hair`
